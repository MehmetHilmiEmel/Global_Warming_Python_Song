# Global_Warming_Python_Song
In this project, I created a mini song with temperature changes in summer from 2000 to 2019. The aim of this project is to use the audio file I created with these data as background music in a video about global warming in order to draw attention to the temperature increases in the summer months on average every year.

# About Data set
The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2019. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980. The standard deviation of the temperature change of the baseline methodology is also available. Data are based on the publicly available GISTEMP data, the Global Surface Temperature Change data distributed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA-GISS).

# How to use MIDI file
After downloading the MIDI file, you can use it in any music making application. I preferred the GarageBand application. Then you can create a song playing this MIDI file with different instruments.
