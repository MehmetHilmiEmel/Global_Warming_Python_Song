# Global_Warming_Python_Song
In this project, I created a mini song with temperature changes in summer from 2000 to 2019. The aim of this project is to use the audio file I created with these data as background music in a video about global warming in order to draw attention to the temperature increases in the summer months on average every year.

# How to use MIDI file
After downloading the MIDI file, you can use it in any music making application. I preferred the GarageBand application. Then you can create a song playing this MIDI file with different instruments.
